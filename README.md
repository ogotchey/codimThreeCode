# codimThreeCode
## Project Overview
This code is dedicated to classifying Differential-Graded (DG) Algebra ring structures on free resolutions of perfect ideals in the trivariate polynomial ring over a (finite) field.  
## M2 Language
The project is implemented in the Macaulay2 programming language, which is an interpreted, functional programming language dedicated to the analysis of mathematical objects.  More information about the [Macaulay2 Language can be found here](http://www2.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/)
