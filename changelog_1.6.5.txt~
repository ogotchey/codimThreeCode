Added in version 1.6.5

-A check is now performed on numTerms to ensure that it doesn't exceed an upper bound determined by the degree bounds
-Added upper bounds to m and n (m<=12 and n<=10)
-The optional boolean argument "logging" of the main function, set to true by default, now controls whether or not a record of new classes is printed to the logfile.
-As a consequence of the above, each call to main is now hardcoded to save metadata to log.  i.e. will do so even when logging==false
